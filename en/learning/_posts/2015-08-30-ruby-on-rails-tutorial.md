This fantastic course was my introduction to both [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). The corresponding
[ebook](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) is freely available online.
I carefully went through this extensive video tutorial in order to build
the online platform for [basimil.ch](https://github.com/basimilch/basimilch-app).
