  Understanding CSS positioning can be tricky, especially for
  beginners to CSS. It is also essential to understand if you want to
  be able to build complex layouts. In this CSS tutorial we'll learn
  about different methods for using CSS to position HTML elements
  including fixed, absolute, relative positioning, and also how to
  float and clear elements. We'll also take a look at the ways each
  type of positioning affects the element it is applied to, and how it
  affects the behavior of elements around it. We'll finish up this CSS
  training by answering one of the most common CSS questions about
  positioning: How to center elements. Software required: Brackets,
  Google Chrome.

Very short and to the point. It's a very nice introduction or
refresh to proper positioning of HTML elements, specially
regarding centering of elements. I practiced what I learned in
this course in [this pen](http://codepen.io/rbf/pen/mRjpKK):
