This already famous introductory MOOC on Machine Learning was first taught
in 2011 and led to the
[founding of Coursera itself](https://blog.coursera.org/a-personal-message-from-co-founder-andrew-ng/).
It was my first proper MOOC and enjoyed it a lot. The required weekly commitment
including the programming exercises was between 3 to 6h.
