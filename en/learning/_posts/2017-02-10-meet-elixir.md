summary: >
  Elixir is a fun language inspired by the best parts of scripting
  languages like Ruby and Python, but built on the industrial strength
  Erlang VM. The multicore, distributed future is here, and Elixir has
  arrived just in time to help you build apps for it! Elixir creator
  Jose Valim (also known as a former committer to Rails and author of
  the wildly popular Devise gem) takes you through his language while
  building a real-world library to parse HTTP streaming metadata
  files.

Very interesting programming session with
[{{site.data.learning.author.jose-valim.name}}]({{site.data.learning.author.jose-valim.github}}),
creator and [main commiter](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/graphs/contributors)
of the [[elixir]] language. The format of the
tutorial is very entertaining and original: instead of doing a
structured introduction to the language, they pick an _arbitrary_
programming task (parsing of HTTP streaming metadata files) and use it
as leitmotiv to cover the main aspects of the language.

I enjoyed the session a lot because it's also a good example of how to
tackle a programming task with a TDD top-down approach. However, as a
first introduction to the language it's a bit rough. It's worth noting
that the curse is a bit old (three and a half years as of this
writing) so that the current state of the language might have evolved
significantly.

This was my first contact with [[elixir]]. While the syntax itself
it's naturally mostly inspired from [[ruby]] and [[erlang]], some
concepts like macros, pipeline operators and messaging were familiar
to me thanks to [[clojure]].

In summary, I really enjoyed this tutorial and also because of the
concise length it's very worth watching.
