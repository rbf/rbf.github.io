Very short and to the point. It uses _traditional_
[ES5](https://johnpapa.net/es5-es2015-typescript/) javascript. It's a very
nice introduction to [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), assuming
good knowledge of html, css and javascript. I practiced what I learnt in this
course in [this pen](http://codepen.io/rbf/pen/dNKwKm).
