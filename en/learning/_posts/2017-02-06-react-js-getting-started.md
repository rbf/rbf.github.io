summary: >
  This course covers the basics of React.js and prepares the student
  to start developing web applications with the library. React.js is a
  an open-source JavaScript library for creating user interfaces with
  a focus on the UI that's abstracted from the DOM, and a one-way
  reactive data flow. The course will explain using an example web
  application how to use React.js. The application will be a simple
  in-browser, math skills kids' game.

Very short and to the point. It uses _traditional_
[ES5](https://johnpapa.net/es5-es2015-typescript/) javascript. It's a very
nice introduction to [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), assuming
good knowledge of html, css and javascript. I practiced what I learnt in this
course in [this pen](http://codepen.io/rbf/pen/dNKwKm).
