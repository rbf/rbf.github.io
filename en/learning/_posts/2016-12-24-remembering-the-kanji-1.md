summary: >
    The aim of this book is to provide the student of Japanese with a
    simple method for correlating the writing and the meaning of
    Japanese characters in such a way as to make them both easy to
    remember. It is intended not only for the beginner, but also for
    the more advanced student looking for some relief from the
    constant frustration of forgetting how to write the kanji, or for
    a way to systematize what he or she already knows.
