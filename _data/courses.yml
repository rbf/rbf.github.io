        This fantastic course was my introduction to both [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
        and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). The corresponding
        [ebook](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) is freely available online.
        I carefully went through this extensive video tutorial in order to build
        the online platform for [basimil.ch](https://github.com/basimilch/basimilch-app).

        This already famous introductory MOOC on Machine Learning was first taught
        in 2011 and led to the
        [founding of Coursera itself](https://blog.coursera.org/a-personal-message-from-co-founder-andrew-ng/).
        It was my first proper MOOC and enjoyed it a lot. The required weekly commitment
        including the programming exercises was between 3 to 6h.

        After this course, you’ll know everything you need to be able to
        separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and
        other cryptocurrencies. You’ll have the conceptual foundations
        you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the
        Bitcoin network. And you’ll be able to integrate ideas from
        Bitcoin in your own projects.

        Very short and to the point. It uses _traditional_
        [ES5](https://johnpapa.net/es5-es2015-typescript/) javascript. It's a very
        nice introduction to [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), assuming
        good knowledge of html, css and javascript. I practiced what I learnt in this
        course in [this pen](http://codepen.io/rbf/pen/dNKwKm).

        Understanding CSS positioning can be tricky, especially for beginners
        to CSS. Software required: Brackets, Google Chrome.

        Very short and to the point. It's a very nice introduction or
        refresh to proper positioning of HTML elements, specially
        regarding centering of elements. I practiced what I learnt in
        this course in [this pen](http://codepen.io/rbf/pen/mRjpKK).
